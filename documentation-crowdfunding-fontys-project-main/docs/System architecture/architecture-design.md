# Architectural Constraints and Design Decisions

## 1. Why Spring Boot?
- **Ease of Development**:  
  Spring Boot simplifies the development of Java-based applications by autowiring and providing a pre-configured setup that eliminates many aspects of the configuration.
- **Integration Capabilities**:  
  Spring Boot provides excellent support for integrating with other technologies and frameworks, such as JPA, making it a versatile choice for building applications.
- **Community and Ecosystem**:  
  It has a large community and a rich ecosystem, which means there are plenty of libraries, documentation, and support available. This reduces the risk and costs associated with development.

### a. Why Not Another Tool or Technology?
- **Node.js/Express**:  
  While Node.js with Express could be an option for building web applications, Spring Boot offers a more structured approach for Java applications, along with support for dependency injection.
- **Django/Flask**:  
  Python frameworks like Django or Flask are great for rapid development, but they may not provide the same level of support for Java-based ecosystems or microservices-oriented architectures.

## 2. Why Are You Using React?
- **Component-Based Architecture**:  
  React's component-based approach allows for modular development, making it easier to maintain and reuse components across the application. This is ideal for creating dynamic, interactive user interfaces.
- **Virtual DOM for Performance**:  
  React uses a Virtual DOM, which optimizes updates and rendering, resulting in better performance for highly interactive UIs and page switching.
- **Flexibility**:  
  React's unopinionated nature allows for greater flexibility in choosing tools for routing, state management, and other functionalities (in this case, using the Next.js framework), as opposed to more opinionated frameworks like Angular.
- **Community and Ecosystem**:  
  With a large community, React has a wide array of third-party libraries, tools, and support, making it easier to find solutions for common problems.

### a. Why Not Another Tool or Technology?
- **Angular**:  
  While Angular offers a more opinionated framework with built-in solutions for routing, forms, and HTTP services, it is more complex and less flexible.
- **Vue.js**:  
  Vue is a viable alternative to React, but I am more familiar with Reactâ€™s Next.js framework.

## 3. Why Are You Using MySQL?
- **Relational Data Requirements**:  
  The project requires structured data storage with relationships between tables, which is well-suited for a relational database like MySQL.
- **Maturity and Stability**:  
  MySQL is a mature and stable database management system, widely used in the industry with robust support for transactions, indexing, and querying.
- **Community and Support**:  
  Being one of the most popular databases, MySQL has a large community, plenty of documentation, and active development, which ensures reliable support.
- **Open-Source and Cost-Effective**:  
  MySQL is open-source, making it a free and widespread technology.

### a. Why Not Another Tool or Technology?
- **PostgreSQL**:  
  While PostgreSQL offers more advanced features, MySQL's ease of use, performance for read-heavy operations, and simpler configuration make it a more suitable choice for the project requirements.
- **NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB)**:  
  NoSQL databases are better suited for unstructured or semi-structured data. Since the project involves structured data with relationships, a relational database like MySQL is more appropriate.
- **SQLite**:  
  SQLite is lightweight and suitable for smaller projects or embedded applications, but may not perform as well as MySQL in larger environments.
